## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer, mentor, and speaker with over 9 years of experience.

I have worked as a Frontend leader for several companies, specializing in building and enhancing large-scale web applications using technologies like Typescript, Angular, NodeJS and React. In these projects, I played a key role as a mentor, sharing knowledge and structuring scalable architectures to streamline development processes.

I am deeply engaged in the IT community, sharing my expertise through blog posts, talks and courses. I act as Frontend and Angular Mentor in the Angular Pro mentoring program, where I guide developers in advancing their careers through weekly technical classes.
